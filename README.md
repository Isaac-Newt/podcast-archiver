# Podcast Archiver

## Installation

To set this program up, you should first download Python from [the Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Run the installer, and follow the instructions. You can install it either for all users, or just the current user.

Once Python is installed, download the code (including the config folder) and save to your computer.

## Using the Podcast Archiver

### Running the program
To run this program, simply double-click the "podcasts.bat" file in your file manager. This will launch the program window.

For each podcast episode downloaded, a folder will be created in the same folder from which the program is run. This folder
will contain an mp3 audio file (the podcast itself) as well as a plaintext file containing the podcast "show notes" as they
appear on the webpage.
