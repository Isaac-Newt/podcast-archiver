# Podcast Archiver

## Installation

### From Python Foundation
To set this program up, you should first download Python from [the Official Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Run the installer, and follow the instructions. You can install it either for all users, or just the current user.

### From the Windows Store
You may also install Python using the Windows store. To do so, simply search for "Python", and install the latest version
(3.9 at time of writing).

## Using the Podcast Archiver

### Running the program
To run this program, simply double-click the "podcasts.bat" file in your file manager. This will launch the program window.

### Program usage
In the program window, select the operation you wish to perform - either downloading all podcast episodes, or only those
published since the program last ran.

For each podcast episode downloaded, a folder will be created in the same folder from which the program is run. This folder
will contain an mp3 audio file (the podcast itself) as well as a plaintext file containing the podcast "show notes" as they
appear on the webpage.
